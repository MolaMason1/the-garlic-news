    <article>
        <p>Late Wednesday night, Richmond became the latest city to face the growing crisis of fentanyl abuse, as residents reported a surge in erratic behavior among the local alley cat population. Witnesses observed rings of cats scouring the streets, high on fentanyl after inadvertently consuming a large stash hidden in the city’s sewer drains.</p>

        <p>Cats were seen darting around, performing acrobatic leaps, and engaging in what can only be described as “feline raves.” Intense yowling echoed into Thursday morning, with local resident Linda Ramirez stating, “It was like a scene from a movie. I looked out my window and saw cats climbing lamp posts, spinning in circles, and flying through the air.”</p>

        <p>Authorities later confirmed that the drugs consumed by the cats were dumped into the sewers by a local drug ring in a desperate attempt to avoid capture. In the aftermath, cat-owning Richmonders launched an emergency “cat recovery” program aimed at helping affected felines return to normal behavior. “When I installed a cat flap a few months ago, I expected the occasional mouse, but never did I expect to find my little Simba with a baggie full of illicit substances. This is an outrage,” exclaimed Sarah Folston, a member of the grassroots initiative.</p>

        <p>Doctors are now recommending catnip as a treatment, likening its effects to methadone for humans with heroin addictions. “Catnip has proven to be a substantial drug in the effort to fight this feline fentanyl crisis,” noted veterinarian Dr. Tabitha Thompson.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, some citizens are advocating for the continuation of the cats’ newfound habits. One Richmond citizen, in protest of these growing “Felines Affected by Fentanyl Substance Abuse” groups or FAFSA for short, in a statement, said, “I don’t know what all this fuss is about. This is going to get rid of the immense rat problem we have. We’ve gotta keep this up. Heck, I’ve got some morphine in the medicine cabinet.”</p>

        <p>As the community grapples with the fallout, the future of Richmond’s feline residents hangs in the hands of the people.</p>
