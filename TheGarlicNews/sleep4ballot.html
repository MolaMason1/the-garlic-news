        <p>Across the country, familiar scenes of overnight camping have begun to unfold—not outside big retail stores, but right outside election polling places. This Election Day, thousands of elderly voters are spending the night under the notion that being the first to the polls will guarantee them the “best ballot.” These seniors have hunkered down in tents, sleeping bags, and pop-up canopies, braving the elements to score the highest-quality vote.</p>

        <p>“It’s simple math,” explains 74-year-old Agatha DiMarco, who arrived at her local polling station just before sunset. “Last time, I showed up after my Mahjong tournament at a quarter to two and had to vote on a ballot that looked like it had been used by half the town. This year, I’m getting one crisp, right out of the box, I’ll tell you,” she explained as she clutched her canister of Earl Grey.</p>

        <p>82-year-old Arthur Englewood, a self-proclaimed librarian, has claimed his spot as the first in line. “I’ve been here for just over twenty-four hours now. I’d rather be here at midnight than wake up to hear they gave all the votes to those damn kids on those smartphones.” When asked why he’d been waiting so long, Englewood, disgruntled, responded, “I got here just after Sunday dinner. I don’t know who in Congress decided to change Election Day to Tuesday.”</p>

        <p>Although the reason for this movement is still unclear, poll workers, baffled but impressed by the turnout, have been assuring the seniors that every voter would receive the same quality ballot. At this time, no one cared to comment, as the majority of the crowd had already been fast asleep.</p>
