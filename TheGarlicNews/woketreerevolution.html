        <p>As election day approaches, the presidential candidates have begun ramping up their campaigning strategies, appealing to all sorts of people. From newspaper ads to television segments, candidates are doing all they can to get into office. Some believe Vice President Harris is utilizing a new technique to secure votes, turning the trees “Woke.” The suspected practice has received outrage from local Republicans.</p>

        <p>42-year-old Colt Hammes expresses his distaste for the backhanded method. “They do this every year, and I’m tired of it, changing our trees for pride or whatever wokeness they’re pushing. I don’t hate LGBTrees, but don’t shove them in our faces. My kids have to see those trees every day, and it’s unacceptable.” Hammes feels concerned about his family’s safety. “Now they come for our trees. What next, our guns? I ain’t shootin’ no gay gun; they got one of them already.” He speculates that the “Gay Ray” is responsible for the colorful change, “I saw it on X once, shoot it at anything and boom, gay. It’s what the Libs use.” adds Hammes.</p>

        <p>There are also theories that Harris’ woke trees are being used to secure the powerful animal vote. Local Republican woman Sharon Rolfson shares her experience with the woke trees, saying, “Crooked Kamala wants my dogs to vote blue—she’s infesting our pets and woodland critters with a woke mindset, and it’s not okay. Leading polls suggest that Harris has a 10-point lead with animals over former president Trump, who has severely neglected them in his campaign.</p>

        <p>If the suspicions are true, the woke trees could be the deciding factor in an election this tight. The backlash from this maneuver could hurt Harris’ chances in office, but the effects have yet to be seen. Be sure to tune in to Garlic News for more updates.</p>
